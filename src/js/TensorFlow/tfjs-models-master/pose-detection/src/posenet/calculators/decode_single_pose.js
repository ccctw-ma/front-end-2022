/**
 * Detects a single pose and finds its parts from part scores and offset
 * vectors. It returns a single pose detection. It works as follows:
 * argmax2d is done on the scores to get the y and x index in the heatmap
 * with the highest score for each part, which is essentially where the
 * part is most likely to exist. This produces a tensor of size 17x2, with
 * each row being the y and x index in the heatmap for each keypoint.
 * The offset vector for each part is retrieved by getting the
 * y and x from the offsets corresponding to the y and x index in the
 * heatmap for that part. This produces a tensor of size 17x2, with each
 * row being the offset vector for the corresponding keypoint.
 * To get the keypoint, each partâ€™s heatmap y and x are multiplied
 * by the output stride then added to their corresponding offset vector,
 * which is in the same scale as the original image.
 *
 * @param heatmapScores 3-D tensor with shape `[height, width, numParts]`.
 * The value of heatmapScores[y, x, k]` is the score of placing the `k`-th
 * object part at position `(y, x)`.
 *
 * @param offsets 3-D tensor with shape `[height, width, numParts * 2]`.
 * The value of [offsets[y, x, k], offsets[y, x, k + numParts]]` is the
 * short range offset vector of the `k`-th  object part at heatmap
 * position `(y, x)`.
 *
 * @param outputStride The output stride that was used when feed-forwarding
 * through the PoseNet model.  Must be 32, 16, or 8.
 *
 * @return A promise that resolves with single pose with a confidence score,
 * which contains an array of keypoints indexed by part id, each with a score
 * and position.
